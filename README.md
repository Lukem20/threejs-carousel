# threejs-sandbox
A place to learn and test out threejs concepts and features.
This project was my first serious step towards learning three.js. The first resource I used was discoverthreejs.com/book/

More recently I am learning Three.js through Bruno Simon's course. I plan on using the concepts practiced here in creating my portfolio and other future projects. 

To see this project, run:
npm install
npm run dev
then open localhost to witness whatever random thing I am currently tinkering with.
